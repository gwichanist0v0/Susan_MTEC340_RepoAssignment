# My Favourite Game
## Susan ZHONG

#### Short Writeup:
- My current favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the kingdom. I haven’t played much of it, but I’ve watched a lot of game play videos about it. The reason this is my favorite right now is not only because of its touching story line, but really the ability to build anything, ANYTHING. Players actually started Industrial Revolution on the Hyrule land, and built so many creative and fun weapons to play with. The potential and the possibility of it, as well as the sound elements in the game all it become my new favorite game.

#### A Similar game: 

1. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
	* - This came before Tears of the kingdom, it's also a very nice game. 
2. 	Pikuniku
	* - I'm not really sure why Pikuniku came up to my mind, you can't really create that many things but the adventure part is some what similar.
